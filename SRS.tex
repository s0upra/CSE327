\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
The system will accommodate three distinct user classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Admin (CEO):} Full control over all aspects of the platform, including task assignments, project management, and user evaluations. Admin can also generate reports on overall system performance.
    \item \textbf{Manager:} Responsible for managing tasks assigned by the Admin and overseeing employee performance. Managers can track task progress, provide feedback, and communicate directly with employees.
    \item \textbf{Employee:} Executes tasks assigned by Managers and reports progress. Employees can track their task status, communicate with Managers, and submit daily updates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Needs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Admin:} Needs a comprehensive dashboard to manage tasks, track progress, generate reports, and evaluate employee performance. Requires the ability to create, edit, or delete user accounts.
    \item \textbf{Manager:} Needs a tool to assign tasks to employees, track their progress, monitor performance statistics, and provide feedback to Admin and Employees.
    \item \textbf{Employee:} Needs a simple interface to view tasks, track progress, and report completed work. Also requires a method for submitting daily reports and receiving feedback from Managers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operating Environment}
The platform will be accessible through modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. It will be compatible with both desktop and mobile devices to ensure broad accessibility. The front-end will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end will utilize PHP or Django, with MySQL for database management. The system will be hosted on a cloud platform to ensure scalability and availability.

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Constraints:} The project must be completed within a specific timeline, with deliverables for each phase of the development cycle.
    \item \textbf{Technology Constraints:} The website will be built with modern web technologies, and any technological limitations or integration challenges should be considered. The use of external libraries and tools should be planned for compatibility.
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Constraints:} The system must comply with data privacy and protection regulations, such as GDPR or other relevant laws, depending on the geographic location of users.
\end{itemize}
